        <div class="u-align-left bullet-points bullets">
            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>You must be 18 or older to purchase from or commission ExclamationBark.</li>
                <li>Square invoices will be used. Do not send payment until you have received an invoice.</li>
                <li>We have pets! Do not commission if you have allergies to cats, please.</li>
                <li><strong>By placing an order with ExclamationBark, you are confirming that you have read, understood, and accept these terms and conditions.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Age</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You must be 18 years or older to commission or buy a fursuit.</strong> We do not work with minors, even with parental permission.</li>
                <li>ID will be required to confirm age. Please blur out all information besides your name, date of birth, and face. Failure to provide a valid ID will result in cancellation.</li>
            </ul>            
            <h5>Allergies</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Please do not purchase from or commission ExclamationBark if you have allergies to cats, as our workspace is animal-friendly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 id="payment">Payment</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Payment will be made through <strong>Square</strong>. Square takes payments by credit, debit, and bank transfer. An account is not required to use this service.</li>
                <li>Full upfront payment is preferred.</li>
                <li>Payment plans of 50% down with a short time frame are acceptable (maximum of 30 days), but please keep in mind that no project will be started until the full payment is covered.</li>
                <li>If payments are not made within the estimated time frame, the project may be dropped. An extended period of absence (over 30 days) without contact will cause the project to be considered abandoned or neglected by the customer.</li>
                <li>Refunds are not accepted for purchased "premade" costume pieces.</li>
                <li>For commissions, <strong>30% of the total payment is non-refundable.</strong> This is to be used for materials and preparation of the project. Should you choose to cancel your commission and request a refund, the amount refunded depends on the amount of work already completed up to the notice of cancellation. </li>
                <li><strong>There are no refunds once the project is complete.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h5 id="shipping">Shipping</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>ExclamationBark uses the United States Postal Service (USPS) for all shipments, unless otherwise discussed. <strong>Shipping costs must be covered by you upon completion of the project.</strong></li>
                <li>The project will be shipped within 3-5 business days of completion and approval. A tracking number will be provided for United States residents.</li>
                <li>Signature confirmation at delivery is required for all items over $500.</li>
                <li>All packages will be fully insured.</li>
                <li>For shipping outside of the US, you will be responsible for any customs fees or duties your product incurs. Please take note of what the incurring taxes and fees will be before committing to a commission.</li>
                <li><strong>ExclamationBark is not responsible for any lost, stolen, or damaged items. </strong></li>
                <li>Between December 10th and January 5th, ExclamationBark will not ship out any large orders. This is due to the increased risk of lost, stolen, and damaged items caused by holiday rush.</li>
                <li>If we are attending the same convention, convention pickup is an option, if discussed ahead of time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Warranty</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Please remember that these pieces are handmade works of art, and may have some imperfections or inconsistencies.</li>
                <li>If the costume arrives with a damaged box, please take photos of the box before opening it. If the costume inside is damaged, please take photos of the damage and contact ExclamationBark immediately.</li>
                <li>ExclamationBark offers a 30 day warranty. This allows for repairs and fixes on any mistakes made by ExclamationBark. Shipping to us is your responsibility, but we will pay for shipping back to you.</li>
                <li>This warranty does <strong>not</strong> cover damages made by you, such as ripped parts, eye damage, and severe misuse.</li>
                <li>ExclamationBark is not responsible for repairs that may be needed due to incorrect measurements provided.</li>
                <li>Alterations to the product by anyone other than ExclamationBark, such as cutting, sewing, or adding additional material, will void the warranty.</li>
                <li><strong>We reserve the right to void warranty at our discretion.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Refunds/Cancellations</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Refunds are not accepted for purchased "premade" costume pieces.</li>
              <li>Refunds are not available for the 30% retainer fee on commissions.</li>
              <li>If a commission has been finished and you are unsatisfied in some way, a refund is not required as the service has been completed. However, ExclamationBark is willing to discuss what is wrong and can attempt to work something out.</li>
              <li>If a commission is cancelled by ExclamationBark due to unexpected events, the client may choose between being refunded in full (including retainer), or be issued a partial refund with any completed costume parts.</li>
              <li>If the commission is cancelled by the client, or must be cancelled by ExclamationBark due to client neglect and/or harassment, the 30% retainer fee will not be refunded under any circumstances.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Communication</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>All correspondence will be done via email.</li>
              <li>If no response is received within 30 days, the commission will be considered abandoned and will be canceled without refund.</li>
              <li>If you will be away and unable to respond, please inform me ahead of time. Communication is important!</li>
              <li>Multiple work in progress photos will be provided. If changes are requested, they must be communicated within 24 hours of receiving the photos.</li>
              <li>If no response is received within 24 hours, progress on the commission will continue. If changes are requested after that window, fees may apply.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 id="quotes">Quotes</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>You must be 18 years of age or older to apply for a quote. You must have a valid quote in order to apply for a commission.</li>
                <li>Quotes will be available approximately one week before a commission opening, on Ko-Fi. They will be valid for the next two commission openings only. Afterwards, you must get a new quote.</li>
                <li>We will not simplify your design for you. Please ensure that your reference sheet reflects how you expect the finished fursuit to look. Additional fees will occur if there are changes to the design after the commission is accepted.</li>
                <li>Reference sheets must be <strong>safe for work</strong>. "Not safe for work" reference sheets will be ignored.</li>
                <li>Receiving a quote does not mean you have been accepted for a commission.</li>
            </ul>
